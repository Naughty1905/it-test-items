# Task №1
We have this big list of (signed) integers.<br> 
We are interested in finding every index &quot;idx&quot; (zero-based, of course) in this list, that has the following <br>
property: <br>
The sum of the integers preceding (but not including) index idx is equal to the sum of the integers <br>
following (again not including) idx. i.e.: (Referring to our list of integers for a moment as &quot;A[]&quot; and the <br>
number of integers in the list N), then we want every index  <br>
idx for which the following is true:  <br>
   A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[idx-1] == A[idx+1] + A[idx+2] ... + A[N-1] <br>
Note that there is likely to be more than one index &quot;idx&quot; in the list that satisfies this property. <br>
Write code that finds every index in our big list that has this property.  <br>
Then, sum up every index that you found, and that is the answer to question 1. <br>
For reference, given the array [-7,1,5,2,-4,3,0], the answer we are looking for is 9 because indices 3 and <br>
6 have the property we are looking for  <br>
(-7 + 1 + 5 == -4 + 3 + 0  and  -7 + 1 + 5 + 2 + -4 + 3 == 0) <br>
and 3 + 6 = 9. <br>
